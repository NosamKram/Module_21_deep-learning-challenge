Neural Network Model

Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis was to use machine learning to predict which charities would be succesful.


Data Preprocessing

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?  
IS_SUCCESSFUL

What variable(s) are the features for your model?  
All columns except IS_SUCCESSFUL

What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features? 
EIN and NAME


Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?  
No

What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
Google Colab crashed so I was unable to do that portion of the challenge.
